# GKeepToQuillpad
This is a script to convert a Google Keep notes archive generated by google's takeout function to Quillpad compatible format

In my search of a replacement for google Keep I found Quillpad, which has backup and restore features.
I made a quite rudimentary python script to convert google keep backups to Quillpad.

For me it works for importing note titles, content, and pinned or not. I didn't make further checks for now but may improve it later.

Steps to use :

-     export your google keep notes with takeout
-     unzip the downloaded archive
-     move all json to a separate folder
-     from this json folder run 
-     python3 GKeepToQuillad.py *.json
-     then run the sed command that is printed on the terminal
-     compress the res/backup.json file in a zip
-     import this zip in Quillpad (you may use KDE connect for example to send it to your phone) and hope it works
